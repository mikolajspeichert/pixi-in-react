# PixiJS in React

`pixi-in-react` is a smaller and simpler alternative for [react-pixi-fiber](https://github.com/michalochman/react-pixi-fiber), and was created based on it.

## Usage

Currently at PoC stage. Until I work on some benchmarks and prove that this lib has purpose, you probably shouldn't use it..
